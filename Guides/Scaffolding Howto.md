## ðŸ§  How to Use It (in Cursor, Vibe, etc.)

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Open It in Cursor

- Drag the `efficio-vibe-scaffolding.md` file into your project or open it directly.

- Keep it pinned in a tab â€” itâ€™s your working doc.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Use It to Scaffold Files or Features

Use the AI assistant with prompts like:

```
md
CopyEdit
// Prompt: Use the Client Management Module section
// Goal: Scaffold a page to add new clients with all standard clothing measurements

"Based on the Client Management Module, generate a new page at `/app/clients/add` with a form that accepts name, phone, email, and standard measurement fields for clothing."
```

Or:

```
md
CopyEdit
"From the Inventory Management section, scaffold a PostgreSQL Drizzle model and a tRPC router for managing fabric stock."
```

### ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Use It to Stay on Track

The markdown file acts like a **mission brief**. Use it to:

- Prioritize features

- Track which features are built

- Communicate vision with collaborators or AI agents

## âœ… Bonus: You Can Also...

- Paste sections into Cursorâ€™s AI input to **regenerate broken components**

- Use the features list as **unit test targets**

- Combine with `todo.md` or `README.md` to build a sprint plan
